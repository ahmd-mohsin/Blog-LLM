Using Large Language Models and Retrieval Augemtented Generation to create blog posts using webscrapping.

## Details
A RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) based LLM blog post generator leverages a combination of retrieval and generation techniques to create content. It first retrieves relevant information from a large corpus of blog posts or articles using a retriever model. The generator model then uses this retrieved information to craft a coherent and engaging blog post. This approach allows the system to produce accurate, contextually relevant, and rich content. The generator can incorporate diverse viewpoints and detailed analysis, mimicking the style of human-written blogs.
